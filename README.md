Jumpbot is a mobile platform videogame. It has been developped by Lo√Øc and Maxime.

This game is easy to play: 
- If on computer: Left click with you mouse in the center of the screen to jump (and on the powerups when you want to use them)
- If on mobile: Only click on the touchscreen. The longer you will click on it, the longest the jump will be.

Try to survive as long as you can!

This game has been optimized for mobile phone (and was originally exported on android)

Here there are all the files from the godot project, so that you can modify whatever you want or even build your own version!

Some link to already built version:
- [Windows]()
- [Linux]()
- [Android]() (old release build that is containing admob: Should be disabled on our side.)
